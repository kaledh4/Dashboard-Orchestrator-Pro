The system says market is cautious. What do you think?
📊 Trader Mode: Focus on RSI, short-term support levels, and intraday volatility.
### 🦅 Macro View The macro context presents a mixed risk sentiment scenario: - **Treasury 10y** yield dropped 2.17%, indicating easing inflation concerns and supporting risk-on sentiment - **DXY** fell 0.70%, weakening the dollar and boosting global risk assets - **Gold surged 3.87%**, yet **oil declined 3.61%** – suggesting broad market instability - **S&P 500 gained 4.75%**, confirming strong risk-on momentum in equity markets - **TASI underperformed (-3.36%)** amid oil price volatility and regional sensitivity Conclusion: **Overwhelming Risk-On** environment driven by equity rallies and dollar weakness, though gold's surge signals underlying caution. ### BTC Market Structure Bitcoin exhibits conflicting signals: - **Price ($90.9K) sits below both MA50 ($102.4K) AND Bull Band ($105.6K EMA21/$110.6K SMA20)** - **Weekly trend remains Bearish** per technical analysis - **Long-term strength**: Price > MA200 ($55.8K) maintains structural integrity - RSI at 35.8 (neutral) confirms no immediate oversold condition Positioning: **Intermediate-term Gravitational Pull Upwards** toward Middle-term supports at MA50 and Bull Bands. ### 🇸🇦 TASI & Global Markets TASI shows **3.36% weekly decline** amid oil price weakness (-3.61%) and regional volatility. This underperformance relative to: 1. Global risk appetite (S&P 500 +4.75%) 2. USD weakness (-0.70%) 3. Gold's safe-haven demand (+3.87%) Suggests: **Region-specific risks outweighing global risk-on momentum**, requiring sector-specific monitoring. ### 🎯 Actionable Verdict ACCUMULATE **Rationale**: ① Structural Bitcoin support intact above MA200 ② Risk-on equities and falling USD creating supportive environment ③ BTC/ETH RSI approaching neutral ground (27-36) ④ Key resistance levels at MA50/Bull Bands contain near-term downside ⑤ Improvement from "Extreme Fear" in sentiment (+11 points in 18 days) **Execution**: Strategic accumulation below $91K for BTC, $3,000 for ETH, targeting: - 50W SMA21 ($105K BTC) on retracement - $3,100 ATH bounce (ETH) ### 📅 Weekly Watchlist 1. **FOMC Monetary Policy Decisions** on December 17: Rate cut sentiments impacting USD & Treasury yields #FedPolicy #DollarDecline 2. **US Labor Market Data Release** December 6: Jobless claims & wages influencing Fed timeline #USJobs #DovishMoves 3. **Middle East Geopolitical Escalations**: Oil supply risks evolving around Dec 5-7 #OilVolatile #Geopolitics 4. **Ethereum Scaling Milestones**: Gas limit expansion progress & Layer2 developments #EthereumScalability #ETHAnalysis 5. **El Salvador Bitcoin Treasury Decisions**: Productivity & fiscal impact reporting #BitcoinAdoption #ElSalvadorCoin Reserve Management
