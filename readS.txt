📊 Executive Summary

Crypto markets show divergence with Bitcoin (-0.40% to $90,939) under minor pressure while Ethereum (+0.59% to $3,032) outperforms, signaling potential altcoin rotation. Macro markets display mixed signals: Gold surges 1.27% ($4,218) amid risk-off undertones, but the S&P 500 (+0.54%) contradicts with risk-on momentum. The DXY (99.46, +0.02%) remains rangebound, while Oil (-0.17%) struggles near $58.55. AI/tech sector lacks dashboard updates, but Gold’s rally and stable yields suggest cautious capital allocation.

Key stress indicators:

DXY (99.46): Neutral-bearish below 100; break below 99.20 would boost crypto.
